# Hdl21 Examples

The built-in examples library. Each is designed to be a straightforward but realistic use-case, and is a self-contained Python program which can be run directly, e.g. with:

```bash
python examples/rdac.py
```

Reading, copying, or cloning these example programs is generally among the best ways to get started.  
And adding an example is a **highly** encouraged form of [pull request](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Hdl21/pulls)!
